# Chatbot Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This is a simple chatbot application developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is trained on predefined intents and tags, providing accurate, context-aware responses based on user input. It is designed to handle multi-turn conversations and is adaptable for various use cases, such as customer service or mental health support.

## Features

- **Intent-based Response**: The chatbot is trained to recognize user inputs and map them to predefined intents and tags to provide appropriate responses.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale for real-world applications, such as customer service and personal assistant tasks.
- **Easy to Extend**: New intents and responses can be added easily to expand functionality.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **NLTK** for tokenization and text processing
- **Scikit-learn** 
## Training the Chatbot

1. Prepare your training data:
   - The training data should consist of user input examples mapped to intents.
   - Example of intent and tags data format:
     intents.json(file name)
     {
       "intents": [
         {
           "tag": "greeting",
           "patterns": ["Hello", "Hi", "Hey"],
           "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Greetings!"]
         },
         {
           "tag": "goodbye",
           "patterns": ["Bye", "Goodbye", "See you later"],
           "responses": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Take care!"]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. Train the chatbot model:
   - Use your chosen NLP techniques (e.g., tokenization, bag-of-words, TF-IDF) to train the chatbot based on intents and tags.

3. Test the chatbot:
   - Run the model on various inputs to ensure it maps correctly to the intents and returns accurate responses.

## Usage

 Interact with the chatbot:
   - The chatbot will respond based on predefined intents and tags. Simply type a query and the chatbot will reply with an appropriate response.

## Future Work

- **Multilingual Support**: Add functionality to handle different languages and improve accessibility.
- **Continuous Learning**: Implement a feedback system to allow the chatbot to learn and adapt based on user interactions.
